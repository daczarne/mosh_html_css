## The box model

Whenever the browser renders an element it places it inside an invisible box. At the core of the box is the **content area**. This is were the elements content goes. Outside the content area we have the **padding**. This is the space between the content area and the **border** of the box. Around each box we have the **margin**.

We can use the CSS property `padding` to control the padding. This property takes up to 4 values that work the same way as the border property seen before. The same holds for the `margin`. But keep in mind that the browser will collapse the margins of elements that are next to each other, while it will not collapse the padding. Therefore, to avoid issues:

- use padding to separate the content and the border
- use margin to separate elements from each other
