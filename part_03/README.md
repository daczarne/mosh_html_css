# Site example

This is the code for building the example site [moshified.com](https://www.moshified.com/). Other additional notes can be found here too.

## Animation

The animations where build using the [Animate on scroll](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) library.

## Building for production

We use build tools to minify CSS and JavaScript, combine them into single files, optimize images, etc. The goal is to reduce the number of requests that the browser needs to send in order to get all the resources it needs to display our page.

There are multiple build tools available. Here we'll use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). To use it you first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
