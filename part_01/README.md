# Web development fundamentals

## Languages and tools of web development

Every web site has two parts: a **front-end** and **back-end**. The front-end is what the user sees in the browser and interacts with. The back-end is everything that happens behind the scenes so that the web page can do what it does. Developers who build both front and back-end systems are called **full-stack** developers.

To build front-end we use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. **HTML** stands for *Hypertext Markup Language* and is used to defined the building blocks of the webpage. HTML is not a programming language, but a mark-up language. **CSS** stands for *Cascading Stylesheet* and is used to style the web page. It controls the aesthetics of the page. CSS is not a programming language either, but a styling language. **JavaScript** is used to control the behavior of the webpage and add functionality to it.

In order to build webpages faster, front-end developers use a variety of frameworks and libraries. Currently, the most popular ones are **React** (library), **Angular** (framework), and **Vue** (framework).

To build the back-end services that websites use, developers use a wide variety of tools. Some of the most popular programming languages are Java, Python, Go, C#, and much more.
