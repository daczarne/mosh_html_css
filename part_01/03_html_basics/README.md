## Head section

We use the head section to give browsers and search engines information about the webpage. We use the self-closing `<meta/>` tag to define metadata about the page. This includes the following:

``` html
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
```

This `meta` defines the character set of the webpage. Nowadays the most commonly used one is `UTF-8`.

Then comes a `meta` for configuring the viewport:

``` html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

The **viewport** is the visible area of a webpage. This area changes depending on the device that the user is using. In the `content` attribute we define the initial width (`width=device-width`), and the zoom factor (`initial-scale=1.0`) of the page.

Another `meta` is the `keywords` meta. This allows us to define keywords for the webpage that are used for search engines for prioritizing results.

``` html
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS">
```

The `description` meta will be displayed in search results when the page is listed as a query result.

``` html
<meta name="description" content="A description of the page" />
```
